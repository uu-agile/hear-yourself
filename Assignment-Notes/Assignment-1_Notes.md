* Plan for Missing Meetings:
 * All Meetings will be recorded.
 * If any team member must miss an Advisor meeting, they must watch the recording, and the first 10 minutes of the next team meeting will be spent reviewing the missed materials.
 * If any team member must miss a Team meeting, that person must provide a list of talking points beforehand. The other team members will record the entire team meeting and include discussion of the absent member's talking points. The absent member should communicate any misunderstanding/misinterpretation by commenting on this video.
