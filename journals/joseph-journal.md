Today Yusaf and I finished our first assignment for Senior Capstone class. We have a good, basic meeting organization that includes:
* weekly team meetings
* weekly advisor meetings (which alternate bi-weekly between Jon Davies and Paul White)
* daily SCRUM meetings

I think the most difficult part will be learning GitHub fast enough that we are able to leverage its functionalities to the fullest potential. I am confident that this challenge will not be too much of a blockade, since Yusaf and I are already learning quickly about how to use GitHub.

I have also created a Discord server for the project. I think this would ideally be a great way for users and engineers to interact with the project/each other whenever. I have organized the roles as follows:
* admin - the only role which may make changes to the server
* engineers - have access to team communications
* users - have access to everything except team communications

We can only see how strongly this is utilized once the project is underway. It was quick to create, and potentially useful.

**Some things to remember**
* **We are *Agile*... we are NOT confined to one workflow, team management scheme, communication platform**
* **Do not rush into design or implementation. The Systems Engineering framework is there to digest the project thoughtfully**
* **I want to develop the project's website more.**
  * right now, we have a basic high-level overview of the project.
  * I would like this website to be the easiet way for Yusaf and I to navigate the project's documents, and an approachable way for the public to observe and track our progress.
  * I like [this project's page](https://prodfreebies.github.io/)
  * Add: link to project journals
  * Add: Link to Documents landing page
  * Add: link to Discord server
