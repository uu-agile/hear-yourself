## Project Overview

We are exploring the values and desires of the modern DJ community and collaboratively responding with a technological embodiment of meaninful features. Under an Agile Development philosophy, we recognize the community as the driving source of ideas, and embrace uncertainty in those ideas as innovative fuel. Agile has historically been applied in software development, but the same principles offer impressive benefits to other projects. In this instance, we apply Agile under a Systems Engineering framework to develop hardware that answers the needs of the DJ community with the ultimate production an integrated and successful product design.

## The Probelm

As the world accelerates under the force of technological innovation, it pays to look back and ask, "as we make things work, what kind of world are we making?" This question was posed by political theorist Langdon Winner, a long-time critic of modern technology. Winner argues that in order to fully realize the human experience; society ought to drastically change the way we develop technology.

The spirit of innovation had its birth in Enlightenment-Era Science and Philosophy, gained momentum with the worldwide drive of scientists and innovators, and continues today under a global effort to sustain its pace. With it came the lightbulb, computer, pacemaker, and the smartphone in your pocket. With it also came the realization of nuclear warfare, decimation of natural resources worldwide, and ultimately the massacuring of millions of indigenous people and cultures, under that original promise of adventure and advancement in the "New World." As we develop advanced technologies, what kind of New World are we making? Are there greater social implications to this rapid acceleration?

Modern technology certainly influences many societies for better and for worse. One of the most pressing issues of our time is the ease and general lack of moderation over widespread plagues of misinformation. There is also the issue of privacy and security which surrounds our personal digital information. In a more subtle, but certainly no less dangerous way, modern technologies have gradually demanded that a series of social contracts including a dependence on highly centralized organizations, gigantism in our conceptions of social and economic well-being, and a blatant lack of democratic freedom in the workplace where we spend much of our lives. Indeed, the technology we create implies the very conditions for how we live. When we restrict the innovating processes to the technical experts, we are restricting the very conditions for how we live.

## Our Solution

In order to regain control of the social contracts we enter with advanced technologies, we must reignite the realization that within every one of us is a unique potential to reason and discuss. Our solution is to value this inherent ability by facilitating community conversation as *part of* the technical development process. Our hypothesis is that Agile Systems Engineering provides one such framework to implement this solution.
