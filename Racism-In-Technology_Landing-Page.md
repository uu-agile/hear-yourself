In creating a public source of information surrounding our technological development efforts, 
we find it important to also provide information about racist tendencies of technology. Below

## Examples of Racially-Biased Technologies
* [Facial recognition technologies](https://theintercept.com/2018/09/06/nypd-surveillance-camera-skin-tone-search/) that target criminal suspects on the basis of skin color
* [Automated risk profiling systems](https://www.propublica.org/article/racial-profiling-ice-immigration-enforcement-pennsylvania) that disproportionately identify Latinx people as illegal immigrants
* [Credit scoring algorithms](https://www.revealnews.org/article/for-people-of-color-banks-are-shutting-the-door-to-homeownership/) that disproportionately identify black people as risks and prevent them from buying homes, getting loans, or finding jobs
