# Basic Background

## What is Git/GitHub
Many engineering students have already some interaction with GitHub. Personally, I had exposure during programming courses using various software installed from GitHub. It may be best to first answer, "What is GitHub?" 
[This introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E) to GitHub helps put the utility of GitHub in perspective. Its main attraction is its ability to track changes and ensure such changes are verified and approved by team members.

What purpose doese GitHub have in a hardware project? This is where fundamental concepts from Systems Engineering come into play. A basic component of Systems Engineering is *configuration management*. As described by the International Systems of Engineering (INCOSE) handbook,
> Configuration management ensures that product functional, performance, and physical characteristics are properly identified, documented, validated, and verified to establish product integrity; that changes to these product characteristics are properly identified, reviewed, approved, documented, and implemented

GitHub could become a promising open-source platform for Systems Engineering, based on the fact that the site already contains excellent version control. It is important for the effectiveness of an eningeering team that *information latency* be minimized which ensures an integrated design process. Github Pages is great for creating, editing, and sharing documents. In fact, it can even be used to [write and publish books](http://braythwayt.com/2015/01/29/how-i-write-books-with-github-and-leanpub.html)! This is why I think GitHub is a promising platform for project management because documents may be quickly created, edited, and quickly accessible to the public via a basic webpage.

## GitHub Pages
This is where GitHub Pages comes into play. GitHub Pages is a feature of GitHub which enables users to publish repositories to the internet as static webpages. To learn more about GitHub Pages, see this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MsN8gpT6jY). 

GitHub Pages allows teams to display their projects to the public in a visually appealing manner, and we could use it in-part for this purpose. The vision is to make the design transparent such that end users may be able to suggest changes as the design proceeds. More fundamentally, GitHub might serve as the design environment itself. Within a series of Markdown documents, we could trace out the requirements, architectural design, and physical implementation of the product, just like a conventional Systems Engineering team might.

# Learn: GitHub

I would recommend [GitHub guides](https://guides.github.com/) as a good, generic resource to refer to as you start to learn GitHub. The most effective way to learn anything is through application. That being said, after making a  [GitHub](https://github.com/), account I have found it very useful to follow the default tutorial within GitHub. This should be provided directly after you make your account, but if you missed this opportunity, you may also find the tutorial [here](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github). (Note: GitHub Learning Lab also has other tutorials you may find helpful, so feel free to explore around!)

# Learn: GitHub Pages

Again, I have found the GitHub guides as the best way to get hands-on exposure to using GitHub Pages. You can access the guide [here](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-pages).

# Learn: Markdown

Markdown is the format used by GitHub Pages, so it is useful to understand how to use Markdown. [Here]() is the GitHub guide for communicating via markdown, which is somewhat helpful. A more in-depth tutorial, which also requires you to remotely access GitHub repositories and so is dually helpful in this regard is [this crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUBNt18RFbo) in Markdown. You may also need to follow the resources in the Git Bash section below. 

# Learn: Git Bash

To get started accessing, editing, and otherwise interacting with documents in GitHub, it may be convenient to access the repository directly from your machine without logging into a browser. If you are on a Windows machine, this can be accomplished using Git Bash. To install Git Bash on Windows 10, follow 
[this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdwWe9COT9k).
