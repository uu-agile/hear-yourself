I don't know if I am spending too much time thinking about how to start targeting the issues, but I feel I need to reorganize the small points so that I can digest them as well as judging enough time for each tasks.

wait, why doen't this has spelling correction? :)

Yesterday, I was trying to gather information about the main points in the overview, but I found myself overwhelmed by the tasks; therefore I need no take another look at the points and make sure I target enough points for today and the rest for tomorrow with good readings and reasearch.

So what I am doing today is gooing over the assigned issues, target at least 4 of them of today, and continue matching reading points and resources to each point.
