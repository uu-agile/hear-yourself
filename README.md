## The Problem

The world is accelerating under the force of technological innovation. This acceleration has its birth in Enlightenment-Era Science and Philosophy, gains momentum with the drive and desire of scientists and entrepreneurs, and continues under a global effort to sustain its pace. With it came the lightbulb, the computer, the pacemaker, and the smartphone in your pocket. With it also came unrestrained and caustic influence of digitally-spread misinformation, pollution of the air we breathe with toxic by-products, nuclear warfare, and, we cannot forget, the massacuring and domination of millions of indigenous people and their cultures under a promise of adventure and advancement in the "New World." 

This acceleration influences many different regions and their societies, for better and for worse. The dominating perspective in this never-ending race has roots in Western ideals and is fortified by the widespread acceptance of a Scientific worldview. Its leaders are the technical experts, its language is technical English, and its decisions are made with the sparkling eyes of technological determinism. But what social, cultural, and political implications exist under the covers?

Many modern-era social scientists, philosophers, and other forward-thinkers of our time track a clear deterioration of individuality, critical reasoning, and personal freedom in urban-industrial civilizations. To summarize the points made by Theodore Roszak, Herbert Marcuse, and Langdon Winner, and others: when technology dictates the way we travel, work, communicate, and even feed our bodies there are obvious interactions which strongly influence the way we govern, interact, and operate within society. The fact is, technology is a political artifact which is far from the neutral apparatus we have since perceived it to be. 

The tragedy is that only a select few individuals have the opportunity to become shapers of the technological world. These are the social, political, and technical experts that are fabricated in high volume at colleges and universities around the globe. Their theories, principles, and techniques are well beyond the layperson. They work behind a veil of expertise where the most critical decisions as to how we develop, implement, and interact with technology are made. 

As long as this remains the case, our social, cultural, and political reality marches toward a confined version of who we ought to be and how we ought to live. A prescribed destiny which is beyond the control of most people. In the words of Langdon Winner, "we ought to lay out the keels of our vessels with due consideration to what means or manner of life best serves our purpose in our voyage over the sea of time" [1]. In other words, we must answer the question: How do we design the technologies we interact with every day toward realizing a world **we** want to live in?

## Our Solution

In order to revive individuality and restore personal freedom, we must reignite the realization that within every one of us is a unique potential to reason and that this potential to reason is opened as creative contribution to how we shape the technological world we live in. With this project, we demonstrate an advancement in this direction.

We believe the expert gap shrinks by applying design methodologies which demand tight communication among project management, developers, and customers. Furthermore, to facilitate a collaborative development of ideas, designs, and to encourage others to explore solutions of their own, we honor an open-source philosophy for its transparency and its ability to facilitate the sharing of knowledge.
