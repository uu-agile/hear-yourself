## Overview

Last meeting we identified a list of features that this device should possess. Today we further refined these features into a [Requirements Outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bQqTBTZVdF1-LQCF3sIWCffZA2er5Wri69iT8PXGsEc/edit?usp=sharing). The goal is to work and massage these requirements to be as specifc as possible, such that they may be smoothly translated into functions. Functions describe the behavior that satisfy the system requirements, and are mapped to the physcal elements which facilitate those functions. Functional architecture is translated into physical architecture via the design process.

## Translation into Requirements

The initial capabilities that were outlined in the first customer review meeting (CRM) are vague descriptions of the desired system.

With this customer review meeting, we refined these features into our initial requirements outline. This outline is structured with the intention of mapping the top-level capabilities into top-level requirements. The goal is for the requirements to be testable and unambiguous. Further refinement is necessary to get the requirements to this point.
