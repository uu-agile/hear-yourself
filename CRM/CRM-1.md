## Overview 

We have identified a "technological direction" along the lines of a Bluetooth speaker, but one with some additional capabilities. These capabilities are outlined by the summary of our first Customer Review Meeting below.

This forms the input to our next "sprint", which will work to generate the following inputs:
* Some sections of our Integrated Management Plan:
  * Key Assumptions
  * Technical Description of the System
  * Work Breakdown Structure
  * Preliminary Budget
  * Key Performance Characteristics
  * Preliminary Support Plan
* A Preliminary Conception of the System Requirements

## Formulation of Initial Capabilities

To enable performance in a greater variety of spaces is to:
* Increase flexibility of input/output
  * *A variety of physical input ports (1/4", 3.5 mm, RCA or XLR) **and** additional Bluetooth options for your phone or laptop.*
  * *The option to pair with several external Bluetooth "audio sinks" which could be a simplified version of this supposed device, or an entirely different Bluetooth speaker*
  * It would be nice to have several input channels too.*
* Reduce Cable clutter
  * *Ideally one would grab their controller/turntable, this device, and a single connection from the controller/turntable to this device.*
* Add Power Source Flexibility
  * *Battery for off-grid use of typically 6 hours.*
  * *Conventional wall plug option too*
  * *Would be neat to have a built-in solar panel for additional flexibility*
* Basic Mixing Capabilities built-in
  * *Stereo/mono, channels, and EQ*
